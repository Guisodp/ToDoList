# ToDoList Project

## Challenges

I already had some knowledge of React.js; however, I needed to review certain concepts and gain more experience with some hooks. I faced a few challenges in understanding new React.js concepts, but they were valuable learning experiences. I also worked on improving my logical thinking to build specific components and functions that I wanted to add to the project.

## Components

I added components such as filtering tasks, searching, marking tasks as completed, deleting them, and options to add a new task, as well as ASC (ascending) and DESC (descending) buttons to choose how to view the task list.

## Techs

- Built the ToDoList with React.js  
- Using Vite as the build tool  
- CSS for styling  
- Dependencies managed via JSON (package.json)
